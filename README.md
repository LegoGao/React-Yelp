## About ##
This project takes advantage of my [React-Redux-Router Start Kit](https://github.com/LegoGao/boilerPlate). Setting up full react / redux / react-router structure takes less than one minute. Front end uses React+Redux+React-Router+Fetch. Back end uses Express(A Node.js framework) to mock REST APIs. There are more than 10 page routers and more than 20 react components. User is able to locate current city, login, browse restaurants, search for restaurants, save a restaurant, add to cart, and write comments for restaurants. This is a relatively complete front end project.
